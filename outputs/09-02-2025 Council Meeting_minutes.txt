This was just for information, so I apologize, don't have a resolution ready. Okay. Um, you want to come back to that? We'll go to 11.6. Um, so I had originally just posted this for information. Um, our communications, marketing and communications coordinator has been working on this procedure um for just probably over a month now. And so it's been ready and we wanted to post it on the website. Uh, so I thought just at the same time we would provide this for council and the public's information. So it's just a moderation procedure that we can follow regarding our social media channels. Um, so we could just pass a resolution accepting it as information at this point. Okay. Councillor Kazinski. Thank you. So who is responsible for the social media in our municipality? Uh, so Hayley Truthwaite is our communications coordinator and she monitors all the social media channels.

And what what the findings are that we're gonna have changes made to the social media procedure? What the findings was that that something happened on the social media that Uh no, I think it's pretty standard practice for most people to have procedures around their social media. So um, just quickly, I could list off Selkirk, City of Winnipeg, the province of Manitoba. If you go onto their website, they'll they'll call it something different, either a moderation policy or terms of use for social media, and it just kind of outlines the guidelines that the public is expected to follow on social media and what the RM can do in response to serious breaches or inappropriate material. So um, the RM does have that option to remove. I don't recall any time that we've had to remove anything so far. Um, but there's always a chance that we would have to in the future, but we wanted to be fully aware to the public what constitutes inappropriate material.

And and it's gonna be that we don't have it right now and and and We had something internally, but um we wanted to post that on on the public website and just for council to be aware. So we had our internal guidelines, but I thought it was more appropriate that the public would be aware of what those guidelines are. So why why municipality will tell anybody what to speak, how to speak and when to speak? Uh, any social media platform would have those guidelines. This isn't new.

And provided by whom? Who provide those guidelines like that? Uh well, Hayley researched that and created those guidelines based on, you know, looking at other people's policies and what seems to be appropriate, not appropriate. And who make the decision what's appropriate, what's not? Staff did. Council passed a social media policy and now this is a guidelines procedure that comes from that policy.

So so we're gonna be limiting people what they can say and how they gonna say it? I don't know it's because of the criticism of the municipality or As I said what basis do we do we do those changing the procedures? So today we have not amended any postings or removed any postings. So actually nothing really bad happening. If there are threats to anybody then anybody just can call whoever threats are associated with, he can call police like Councillor Warren did. If was threat then she called the police and you know But we're not going to allow people to threaten each other on social media. So that would be a post that we would probably remove if someone was threatening to cause harm. Why would you remove and why wouldn't just somebody call police on that? Well, we would remove it and call the police. Oh, okay.

And it's up to municipality to do that as long it threat is made to who, like um, your employees or or our municipal employees. Well, our communication employees trained in this area. So she would be the best person to moderate social media and decide what's appropriate or not. Well, did I I never spoke with this person about social media, how as a council we can make that decision. We never spoke about this lady who's gonna make the decision. Well, I I guess It's it's up to the councillors to to make those No. No, it's not up to council. They don't Council doesn't moderate the social media, staff does. No. I didn't say that. It's council to to provide the directions for the our employees or through you, of course, through a CEO. And we do that through the social media policy that was passed and approved by council resolution.

Never never that I was aware about it. When was that done? I don't have the date offhand. I can provide council with the policy, but within the policy it does say what's allowed and not allowed. So this document is just something we put together for the public to to know what's appropriate or not. Okay, so we wait for that date of that um when when that happened was presented council approved that. Thank you.

Um, the only thing I could add to that is is anonymous there. Do we take anonymous uh I know that Facebook there they have anonymous there and my idea whether it's necessary or not is just that's something we can take back to Hayley or you guys who can look at it. Uh, if it's anonymous then we should not be putting it on there. That's just my opinion. And I know anonymous is included in other people's content, but um we find even our Zoom meetings, sometimes people will log in anonymously and use different names, so we don't know who those people are. So we're not too concerned about whether they're anonymous or not. We're just looking at the comments being made. Okay. Should we put in anonymous there as as a stipulation? But like you say, I guess what you're saying is that they could put down there Richard Nixon there and uh we wouldn't know otherwise, but that makes sense. The deputy mayor.

Yeah, I just want to make it known that I support this procedure and I believe if there's something that is said or done that's so strong that they'll end up be talking to the councillors or that and we'll be aware of it. But having said that, I'm fully in support of this procedure. Thank you. I am as well. Mark. Uh thank you. I think it is important to have a guideline and some policies to restrict obviously racist and and comments that could be hurtful to to people and and such. In terms of what the mayor is saying in terms of anonymous, I think it's right. Uh, it would be nice for people to disclose themselves, but they can just go under fictitious names. So I'm not sure that we can really solve that point. Um, I do want to make a comment that uh a resident, Mr. Giesbrecht, did send in some notes and he's got some very specific concerns. I'm not sure I share all of those concerns, but um I think members of council have had the opportunity to read that and if the CAE could show or could share that with um the marketing and communications person, so they know what at least his concerns are. And of course, if other residents have have concerns. What we don't want to do is is funnel and kind of channel what the discussion is. Uh, uh we're not a police state and we don't want to be. We want people to have the free ability to share information, share concerns, share but not be racist, hurtful or any of those kinds of things. So I think it's important for us to have some sort of guidelines like this.

And for your information, I did share um the resident's document with Hayley already and I said after tonight any other comments we would discuss it later. So Any other questions at all? I see none. Is that for a vote or just information? Uh well, we had I think moved by Councillor Warren, seconded by Councillor Fuel. "Be it resolved that council accept the social media moderation procedure." Okay. Could I get a show of hands those in support? Unanimous, so carried.

Um, then we'll just go to uh to adjournment or I'm sorry, we got the addition on there. Uh, replacement of the discharge pump, 11.6. Mover and seconder please for that. Tarion and Warren.

"Be it resolved that council of the RM of Springfield authorize the purchase of a Flygt model BS-2250 submersible pump from Contact Projects Limited to replace the failed discharge pump at the Main Street LDS lift station in Oak Bank at Main Street and Oakwood Road in the amount of $87,600 plus applicable taxes, tariffs and reinstallation costs, including electrical and mechanical."

Um, I just had a question there, CEO there. Um, this was something on the 28th identified. Um there is there not provisions for excellent circumstances there that this is something like are we holding off on this now until the council has made a decision on it? Uh, so I think Phil is online, but he had made me aware um a week ago and then he's been attempting to get as many quotes as he could. So he did receive two quotes. Um, so the reason for the report is council approval is required as this is an emergency purchase required due to the immediate need and time constraint and that this item was unforeseen and therefore not included in the 2025 financial plan. Okay. So we could have ordered it and then then come to council for approval after the fact, but we felt that adding to tonight's we still had the time to get it approved. And there is, I think he put in the timeline a 10 to 12 week um order period, so we didn't want to get this in as soon as possible. Yeah. And I I guess we just want to to clarify the um if it's uh one of those circumstances there, if it happens on a Friday and a long weekend or something like that. Don't want somebody to be hindered for doing uh their job and I Phil's doing an exceptional job, don't get me wrong there. It's just uh the if it's needed, it's needed and let's let's just do it uh and then bring it to us later on, which is essentially what happened here. But I'm just as long as we reiterate the fact that there shouldn't be uh you know uh um you know held held to this the policy when excellent circumstances may require this kind of an expense. And I guess I'd say if it's 10 to 12 weeks, it's an extra four days isn't gonna make a difference, but he's already doing his due diligence anyway, so. Yeah. And I think Phil made a good call to put in a temporary pump, so we have a reduced capacity right now, so it gives us a little breathing room to get that pump ordered, so. Yeah. No criticism on Phil. I think it's exceptional job uh but uh Councillor Kazinski. Thank you. So do we have a program that we check our periodically our our equipment like that, so we can see what what's happening with this equipment, like for instance this pump maybe every two years, every three years. We should have the pump uh you know, programs set up, procedures that, you know, our department are checking on that equipment, so we don't have this situation happening like that.

Yeah, so I I think they do do general operation and maintenance, but it was during operation that they noticed it wasn't working properly, but maybe Phil can add more to that if he wants. Um, but I think yeah, they do do maintenance. It was just this pump's time. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, it happened. It's from 1981, so you know. Yeah. It's due for replacement anyway, so thank you. All right, any other questions from council? Um, if uh we've read the resolution. If I can get a show of hands those in support. That is unanimous and so carried. Uh, nothing for closed meeting there. If we can go to adjournment. Uh, mover and seconder for item 14 for adjournment please. Miller and uh Warren. And uh show of hands of those in support. Unanimous, carried. Thank you very much. And we'll close at 6:25. Thank you.
